"""Bounded CPU reads for an already agreed expert-swap plan.

This helper neither chooses experts nor touches arena slots, CUDA, routing masks or
LRU state. A caller may stage a frozen plan while the old resident set keeps serving,
then install its records at the normal agreed boundary. Each installed record's
release admits one more read, keeping the complete pipeline bounded.

Records own their bytes. ``take`` transfers ownership to the caller, which must
release each record *after* installation has finished reading it. Ready, running,
cancelled and borrowed records all share one byte budget, including across plans.

Experimental only; not connected to serving. On 32 real checkpoint experts with
four retained payloads and two readers, owning-copy staging took 104.23 ms versus
77.53 ms for the existing serial leased reader (+34.4%, three samples per arm,
no simulated install delay). See docs/gotchas.md before revisiting this path.
