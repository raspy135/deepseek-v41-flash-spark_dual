model.py -- DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash text model for one-box serving: chunked prefill, multi-token
decode blocks (DSpark verification) and cache rollback, batch size 1.

Ported from the reference `inference/model.py`; the tilelang kernels are replaced by torch ops
and the routed experts by `engine.experts.ExpertStore` (+ the Triton FP4 grouped-MoE kernel in
`tools/fp4_moe.py`). Activation quantization is optional; the window KV and indexer's Q/K remain
in bf16. Compressed KV values are quantize/dequantized to FP4-E4M3 before being stored in bf16.
Position semantics are the reference's: a chunk of T tokens at absolute start position S.
Any (S, T) with T <= 512 works, which is what chunked prefill and 6-token verify blocks need.
