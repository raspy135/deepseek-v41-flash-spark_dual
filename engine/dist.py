"""dist.py -- EP2 glue: expert-parallel across two ranks, nothing else.

The design is in docs/dual-spark-plan.md ("EP2 with replicated attention"): every weight and
every computation EXCEPT the routed experts is bit-identically replicated on both nodes, and
the only new distributed operation in the whole engine is one fp32 all-reduce of the routed
MoE partial sum per main-model layer.

Ownership is `expert_id % world_size == rank` -- interleaved, not contiguous, because the
warm-start ranking (results/trace-*/stats/coverage.json) is a global order and parity
splitting keeps both arenas equally good without either rank knowing the other's set.

world_size <= 1  ->  EPDistributed() is inert: `active` is False, no process group is
created, and every call site below is skipped. The single-box path is untouched by this
module, on purpose.

NOT bit-identical to single-node by construction: the 6-term routed sum becomes
(owned subset) + (complement) added once in fp32, which rounds differently than one 6-term
sum. The correctness bar for dual mode is therefore the repo's existing gates -- spec
losslessness (drafted vs greedy identical ON the same config) and held-out NLL within
+/-0.01 nats of the single-node run -- not bit equality. See docs/dual-spark-plan.md Phase 2.

        *when rank 0 stops*, and that is not a theoretical gap:

          * a text stop sequence ("\\n\\nUser:") is detected by server/app.py on the detokenized

          * a client disconnect or any server-side error closes the generator, raising

        evaluates its own. A CPU tensor keeps this on the Gloo half of the mixed group -- no CUDA
        sync, no interleaving with the in-flight NCCL combines, just the host bool the loop needs.
