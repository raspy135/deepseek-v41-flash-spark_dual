# dual-build.sh -- build the serving image once and put the SAME image on both Sparks.
#
# It builds locally and ships the result over the 200G link with `docker save | docker load`
# rather than running `docker build` on each box. That is deliberate: two independent builds
# of this Dockerfile are not guaranteed to be the same image (apt and PyPI both move under
# you, and the base tag is mutable), and EP2 is exactly the workload that punishes skew --
# two ranks running different torch or different engine code do not disagree about an answer,
# they wedge on a mismatched collective. One build, one image id, verified on both sides.
#
# The transfer is ~10 GB. Over the direct-attach link that is seconds; over WiFi it is not,
# so this uses the same PEER address the engine does.
#
# Usage: scripts/dual-build.sh [--local-only]
